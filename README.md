I have decided to create a personal portfolio site in order to showcase insightful information about me. This includes information such as a page describing about myself, my educational history, skill set as well as projects completed. The page also provide a means for people to be able to send messages to me as well as to contact me.

**Employers and interested parties are able to view my site to be able to gain a better understanding of my abilities and my educational history.**
 
## Design Process
 
As this is a personal portfolio site, information should be presented in a neat manner where people visiting the site are able to see what they want to see at a glance. The design of the webpage should also look smart and professional. Another consideration to take note is that mobile viewers should also be able to access the site without encountering any problems reading the information. With the knowledge that employers would be viewing my website, I set to ensure that my website is presentable and is able to catch my future employer's attention.

Before starting to code the website, I created a wireframe and thought about the number and types of pages I would have on my website. A wireframe helps me visualise the structure of my website so I would be able to code it effectively later on. It also helps me avoid poor design decisions made during the coding stage. The wireframe of my website is located in this repository.

For my Homepage(index.html), I have decided to make it look like a landing site to welcome people to my website. I find that being able to warmly welcome the people visiting my site is just as important as, for example, people visiting my house. Hence, I provided my homepage with an elegant feel, with the welcome statements being in blocks of itself so that it is relaxing to read. Red and blue are primary colours which I have implemented for the background colour of the welcome statements. Purple is the mixture of red and blue, and it fits well to end the welcome statements. I have also added a photo of myself to finish off the welcome on the homepage. At the bottom of the website, I have added navigation boxes for people to click and go to their interested pages at my website. This includes "About me", "Education", "Skills", "Projects" and "Contact Me". I have added a background photo of raindrops which I have taken a few years ago as I find that it gives a relaxing feel to the homepage.

For the page "About Me", it gives a description about myself and people who visit this page would be able to get to know more about me, what I like and my goals. I felt that explaining about my goals would be quite essential so that employers know my motivations well.

For the page "Education", it features my educational history in from Primary School, to Secondary School, and Polytechnic. It includes the years that I was studying at the school, my certifications, my CCA, roles held and my awards.

For the page "Skills", it showcases some of the skills I have learnt from my time in Secondary School and Polytehnic. I have included some soft skills which best describes me as well.

Both education and skills page are equally important as employers would need to see what skills I would be able to offer to the company. My education history also speaks a lot about what I have experienced and my achievements and roles will help to elevate the impression of me. Soft skills are just as important when working with a team of colleagues.

For the "Projects" page, I have included a few of the projects I have completed with description for each of them. Each project is different in nature and I felt that it each deserves a block of its own, rather than squeezing them into a box. This allows for equal emphasis for each project.

For the "Education", "Skills" and "Projects" page, I have included hexagonal backgrounds with variations in color. It gives off a professional feel to the website, while complimenting with the dark grey background.

For the "Contact Me" page, I have included 3 social platforms (LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram), my contact information such as my phone number and email, and a form which people could send messages to me through the page. These are some means and ways that employers could contact me.

## Features

- **Feature 1**: The navigation buttons glows up and grows slightly wherever the cursor is at, making it very interactive and easy to see when accessing the menu bar.
- **Feature 2**: Some images change border colour while some may grow when hovered over by the cursor, making the images interactive and easily viewable.
- **Feature 3**: Border colors of each section in the skill page changes depending on where the cursor is at, hence making the skill page interactive.
- **Feature 4**: In the "Projects" page, clicking on the photo opens up the image in full size.
- **Feature 5**: Backgrounds in "Education", "Skills" and "Projects" are fixed, giving the backgrounds depth when scrolling on the website.
- **Feature 6**: In the "Contact Me" page, upon hovering on the social media box, it expands and glows. The icons grow when they are hovered as well. The width of the input boxes for the message form grows when hovered over, hence long emails or names can be seen.
- **Feature 7**: A Hamburger Menu is implemented for mobile users. It toggles the navigation menu when clicked and the navigation menu can be retracted upon clicking on the hamburger menu again.
- **Feature 8**: Sending messages will display a pop-up thank you message to the sender as well as displaying the thank you message underneath the "Send Message" button. If the sender sends another message, the message underneath the button changes to "Another message has been sent!...".
- **Feature 9**: All pages are fully responsive on mobile devices, hence people are able to view the website through their mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript <br>
    The website uses JavaScript for the Hamburger Menu and the Thank You message after sending a message.

- Adobe Illustrator <br>  
    Used for the design of my hexagonal backgrounds.

## Testing

**1. Resizable Menu Bar**
   1. Drag the browser window corner to resize window.
   2. Ensure that the menu buttons warp and goes to the next line without changing size or overflowing.

**2. Hamburger Menu**
   1. Ensure width of browser window or device is 500px or below.
   2. Menu bar should disappear and replaced by a hamburger button.
   3. Click on hamburger button and see if the the navigation display appears.
   4. Click on hamburger button again and ensure that the menu retracts.

**3. Thank you Message**
   1. Go to "Contact Me" page.
   2. Try to submit an empty form and ensure that an error message "Please fill out this field" appears.
   3. Try keying in invalid email such as taking away '@'. Ensure that there is an error message "Please include an '@' in the email address..."
   4. Submit a form with all required fields filled out. Verify that an alert appears saying that the message was sent and a thank you message appears below the "Send Message" button.

In the homepage, reducing window width to 900px will make the information display as a column.
In the contact me and education page, reducing window width to 700px will make the information display as a column.
In the projects page, reducing window width to 875px will make images for "Designing for a Mobile App" project display as a column.
In the contact me page, reducing window width to 600px will make social platform icons as a column.
Overall, content on all pages would be displayed as a column when viewed on mobile devices.
