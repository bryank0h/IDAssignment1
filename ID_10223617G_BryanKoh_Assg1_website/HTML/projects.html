            <br>
            <p>This game is created as a final assignment upon learning the basics of the Python Programming Language.<br><br>
                The player is the mayor of a city known as "Simp City", and the goal of the game is to build the happiest and most prosperous city possible.<br><br>
                The player's main objective is to score the most points possible by building among 5 different buildings in 16 turns. Each building's placement has an effect on the amount of points earned, hence this places the player's strategic mind to the test in order to score the most points.

            <p>These designs are created as part of a few assignments upon learning the basics of Adobe Illustrator and Design Principles.<br><br>
            I have chosen to work on the app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sandisk-ixpand-drive/id1079870681" target="_blank">SanDisk iXpandâ„¢ Drive</a>. I have redesigned a new app icon, a splash screen as well as created an infographic chart to promote the app as part of learning Design Principles.<br><br>
            Notice: These projects are reimagined designs of the app. It is not created for any sponsorship or commission. However, please do not reproduce or distribute any of my projects without permission.</p>

            <p>This website is created as part of a final assignment upon learning the fundamentals of Cyber Security.<br><br>
                The task was to create a website to strengthen cybersecurity awareness. My team has decided to raise the awareness about a malware known as Adware.<br><br>
                "Adwares are computer programs that are designed to display advertisements on your computer or mobile device, redirect your search request to advertising websites and collect data about you. 
                This information is then used for marketing purposes and to deliver custom advertisements to you."<br><br>
                My team's website on Adware can be found <a href="https://csfassignmentad.wixsite.com/adware-team5" target="_blank">here</a>.
