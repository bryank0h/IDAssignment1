                    <p>Hello, my name is Bryan Koh. I am currently a student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, pursuing a diploma in Information Technology.
                        I aspire to become a software engineer, as well as being able to develop mobile applications that will benefit the society someday.<br><br> 
                        A few of my pastimes include eating delicious food, listening to music, playing video games and practice coding.<br><br>
                        My aim is to become proficient in programming languages that are popular and be able to apply these skills to develop software. 
                        The challenge of learning various programming languages reminds and motivates me that I still have a long road ahead of me and never to throw in the towel easily. 
                        With a constant drive to pursue my goals and gaining experiences such as from an internship, I shall be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in what I do.
                    </p>
